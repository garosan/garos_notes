# ðŸŒŒ Galaxies

There are about 51 galaxies in the Local Group.
On the order of 100,000 in the Local Supercluster
An estimated 100 billion in all of the observable universe.

The discovery of the nature of galaxies as distinct from other nebulae (interstellar clouds) was made in the 1920s.

## Notable Glaxy Groups

- Local Group: The group where the Milky Way is located.
- Stephan's Quintet:
- Robert's Quartet: One of the best examples of compact galaxy groups.
- Bullet Group: The merging group exhibits separation of dark matter from normal matter

## Local Group

The Local Group is the galaxy group that includes the Milky Way and the Andromeda Galaxy. It has a total diameter of roughly 3 megaparsecs. It consists of two collections of galaxies in a "dumbbell" shape. The Milky Way and its satellites is in one lobe, and the Andromeda Galaxy and its satellites is in another lobe. The two 'lobes' are separated by about 800 kiloparsecs and are moving toward one another with a velocity of 123km/s.

The group itself is a part of the larger Virgo Supercluster, which may be a part of the Laniakea Supercluster. The exact number of galaxies in the Local Group is unknown as some are occluded by the Milky Way; however, at least 80 members are known, most of which are dwarf galaxies.

### 6 Largest Local Group galaxies

- Triangulum Galaxy. Diameter: 61k ly
- Large Magellanic Cloud. Diameter: 32k ly
- NGC 3109. Diameter: 25.4k ly
- Small Magellanic Cloud. Diameter: 18.9k ly

The term "The Local Group" was introduced by Edwin Hubble in his 1936 book _The Realm of the Nebulae_.
