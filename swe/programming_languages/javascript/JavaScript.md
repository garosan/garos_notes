# ‚≠ê JavaScript Topics

In my desire to create an exhaustive learning hub of JavaScript topics I am taking notes from 2 main sources:

- [The Complete JavaScript Course From Zero to Expert by Jonas Schmedtmann on Udemy](./complete_js_course/TheCompleteJavaScriptCourse.md)
- [The Modern JavaScript Tutorial](./modern_js_tutorial/TheModernJavaScriptTutorial.md)

As well as from several books:

- Clean Code in JavaScript
- Essential Cryptography for JavaScript Developers
- JavaScript from Beginner to Professional
- Learning JavaScript Data Structures and Algorithms
- Object Oriented JavaScript
- Professional JavaScript
